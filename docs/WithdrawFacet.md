# WithdrawFacet

## Description

Utility facet used for withdraw funds accidentally sent to the contract or left over from a transaction.

## Caution

Withdrawal can only be done by the contract owner which is a single admin key. While the contract is designed to prevent any funds from being left over, any funds sent to the contract will effectively be in the control of the admin wallet.
